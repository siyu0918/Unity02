Deep Sea Boids
A Unity-based simulation featuring a Boids flocking algorithm set in a mysterious underwater ruin. Watch as the "birds" of the deep sea navigate through ancient structures and react to your presence.

🌊 Atmosphere
The project combines fluid group movement with a "deep sea ruin" aesthetic. The entities move based on three classic rules: Separation, Alignment, and Cohesion, creating life-like swarming behavior.

🎮 How to Interact
You can influence the swarm in real-time using your mouse:

Follow the Leader: Left Click anywhere in the scene. The swarm will change direction and gather towards your cursor.

Hidden Secret: Find a glowing object (Light Source) and Hold Left Click on it for more than 5 seconds. This will trigger a special hidden animation and visual effect.
